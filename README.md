# FarmConnect-Empowering-Farmers-with-Smart-Agriculture


It is a multi-faceted product idea, that brings together three fundamentals, the knowledge of which, we believe will help our farmers grow and prosper better in the field. Our product comprises a user-friendly mobile application along with ground sensors that will be connected to the app.


Purpose: 

Agriculture is the primary source of income for India and such an important sector, it is important that our farmers are aware of their rights, needs, and the various resources available for them, alongside the knowledge of how they can implement these.

The objective of the Project: 

We seek to provide three sections/kinds of information to our farmers in the form of an app+sensors to help them:
Section 1 – Awareness section: Aims to spread awareness, giving our farmers important information for their growth and development which will help them understand the advantages and opportunities available to them.
Section 2 – Current Crop/Soil Information: Gives our farmers alerts by using sensors that connect to the app and update the user of any important information such as humidity conditions, temperature, rain, soil moistness, etc.
Section 3 – Predictive Analysis: Predicts and gives instructions to the farmers about what should be done for better quality and life of the crops, by using the information received by the sensors alongside information of future weather forecasts and prior knowledge of crop needs.
Section 4 – News Feed: This allows our users to come together and post updates on their requirements, needs, and current happenings.

Features and Applications: 
We acknowledge the need to create an app with a minimalistic interface to help our farmers navigate through the app easily, we plan to split and club these features as and where possible:

1. Awareness Section:
A page devoted to techniques explaining different types of advanced techniques that one can use in agriculture such as crop rotation and its benefits etc.
Policies of the government that provide support and/or subsidiaries for farmers.
Programmes that have recently come up that could help these farmers which could be due to changing circumstances such as COVID19 etc.
NGOs, websites and other contacts that may be of help to the farmers listed for them to reach out to.
Other educational/informative material.

2. Real-Time Data:
Displays real-time details of humidity, temperature, and soil moisture using sensors placed at the field.
If any of the above conditions are beyond a certain limit (limit is either specified by the farmer or pre-determined by applying machine learning algorithms to previous data), the app will automatically send push notifications.
This data can be sent for the processing which will lead them to functionalities/applications explained in section 3.

3. Predictive Analysis:
Combines information gathered through weather forecasts, prior information about the crop, and real-time details to give important instructions such as extra water needed, infections, harvest time, etc.

4. News Feed:
Gives the timing and place of the post, helping our users better segregate who they can/want to reach out to and help/discuss with.

5. Comfort enhancing features:
Making the app have a feature of multiple languages, which helps us overcome the language barrier.  (Currently, we have both Hindi and English options available.)


Tools and Technologies Used:

Application Development: 
Flutter ,Firebase, AMD instances and Google cloud

Sensors: 
pH sensors, agricultural temperature sensors, Electrochemical Sensors, Optical Sensors

ML:
OpenCV for image processing, Sci kit library for classifying data and prediction, Neural Networks to learn from observational data. (More technologies may be used according to need/to better the implementation of the proposed solution.)

Database: 
Google’s Firestore for authentication and storage.
Languages used: Dart, Python, and its required libraries/modules.
Development environments: Android Studio, VS Code, Git

Project Application in Real-Life:
1.Increased produce and overall productivity due to the constant knowledge being provided to them for use.
2.Helps aid the issue of sustainable development and future planning
3.The use of automated systems will give our farmers more time on their hands and increase their efficiency.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

Section 1 - Awareness:

Identify the information and resources that are relevant and valuable for farmers' growth and development, such as crop cultivation techniques, market trends, government policies, and financial opportunities.
Gather and curate the information from reliable sources, such as agricultural research institutes, government agencies, and industry experts.
Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers to access the information through the app, using web or mobile technologies based on the target platform and user preferences.
Implement features such as search, filters, and bookmarks to help farmers easily find and save relevant information.
Incorporate multimedia elements, such as images, videos, and infographics, to enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of the awareness section.

Section 2 - Current Crop/Soil Information:

Integrate sensors, such as humidity sensors, temperature sensors, rain gauges, and soil moisture sensors, with the app to collect real-time data on crop and soil conditions.
Utilize Google Cloud IoT Core, a managed service for connecting, managing, and ingesting data from IoT devices, to securely transmit and store the sensor data in the cloud.
Process the sensor data using Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully managed data processing service, to derive meaningful insights, such as crop water requirements, pest and disease risks, and fertilizer recommendations.
Display the processed sensor data and insights in the app's user interface, providing farmers with up-to-date information about their crop and soil conditions.
Set up push notifications or alerts to notify farmers of any critical changes in crop or soil conditions, helping them make informed decisions in a timely manner.

Section 3 - Predictive Analysis:

Utilize historical weather data, crop growth models, and machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions, such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity, and their impacts on crop growth.
Integrate the predictive models with the app's backend using Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, a managed service for training and deploying machine learning models in the cloud.
Combine the real-time sensor data from Section 2 with the predictive models to generate personalized recommendations and instructions for farmers, such as irrigation scheduling, pest management, and crop harvesting.
Display the recommendations and instructions in the app's user interface, providing farmers with actionable insights to optimize their crop management practices.
Continuously update and refine the predictive models based on feedback and performance evaluation, to improve the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations over time.

Section 4 - News Feed:

Implement a social networking feature in the app that allows farmers to create profiles, connect with other farmers, and post updates on their requirements, needs, and current happenings.
Utilize Google Cloud Firestore, a serverless NoSQL document database, to store and retrieve the user-generated content, such as posts, comments, and user profiles.
Implement features such as news feed, notifications, and search to enable farmers to discover and interact with relevant posts from other farmers.
Provide moderation and security measures, such as content filtering, user authentication, and data encryption, to ensure the safety and integrity of the user-generated content.
Foster a supportive and collaborative community of farmers by facilitating communication, knowledge sharing, and mutual assistance through the news feed feature.
Overall, the implementation of the "FarmConnect" app using Google Cloud and AMD instances would involve setting up and configuring the necessary cloud services, developing the frontend and backend components of the app using appropriate technologies, integrating with IoT sensors for real-time data collection, implementing machine learning models for predictive analysis, and incorporating social networking features for the news feed. Continuous monitoring, testing, and optimization would also be essential.
